# Big-City

# Catch (or kill) the escaping prisoners in this randomly generated city.

In this game you will pilot a ship flying through the city to catch, and potentially kill, those criminals.


# Things to be done

I will have to make a script that randomly generates a city.
A script for the AI that will go around the city.
And a way to catch (or kill) the enemies.
